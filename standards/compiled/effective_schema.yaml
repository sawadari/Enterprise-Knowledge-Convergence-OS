edge_definitions:
  allocate:
    from:
      - Function
    to:
      - Component
      - Block
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Function → Structure allocation (Function → Component/Block)
    note: Maps functional architecture to physical architecture
  approves:
    from:
      - Agreement
    to:
      - Need
      - Requirement
      - ValidationQuestion
      - VerificationCase
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Agreement approves target artifact
    note: This is a derived edge in EKC-OS, computed from Agreement.target_ref
  connect:
    from:
      - Port
    to:
      - Port
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Port-to-port connection (Port → Port)
    note: Represents interface connections
  contextualizes:
    from:
      - ConOps
      - OpsCon
    to:
      - Need
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Context document provides context for Need
  decompose:
    from:
      - Block
      - Component
      - Function
    to:
      - Block
      - Component
      - Function
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Hierarchical decomposition (parent → child)
    note: Used for hierarchical breakdown of system elements
  expresses:
    from:
      - Stakeholder
    to:
      - Need
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Stakeholder expresses a Need
  hasPort:
    from:
      - Block
      - Component
      - Function
    to:
      - Port
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Ownership relationship from container to port
  hasValidationQuestion:
    from:
      - Need
    to:
      - ValidationQuestion
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Need has a validation question to be answered
  partOf:
    from:
      - Port
      - Block
      - Component
    to:
      - Block
      - Component
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Containment/belonging (part → whole)
    note: Inverse of composition relationship
  refinesTo:
    from:
      - Need
    to:
      - Requirement
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: T1 standard (Why -> What). Need refines into concrete Requirement.
    note: This is the fundamental traceability link in NRVV
  supportedBy:
    from:
      - ValidationQuestion
    to:
      - ValidationEvidence
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: ValidationQuestion is supported by ValidationEvidence

      - Agreement
      - Function
      - Component
      - Block
      - Port
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: Generic trace (1-hop, semantics defined by dictionary/usage)
    note: Generic traceability link when specific relationship is not defined
  verifies:
    from:
      - VerificationCase
    to:
      - Requirement
    cardinality: 0..*
    semantics: VerificationCase verifies that Requirement is correctly implemented
