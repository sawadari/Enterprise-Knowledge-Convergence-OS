# General purpose structure/design/trace vocabulary (INCOSE/MBSE foundation)

syseng_core_schema:
  name: "SysEng Core Schema Extension"
  version: "2.0.0"
  purpose: |
    Provides generic structural and traceability relationships.
    Based on INCOSE/MBSE best practices.
    Core schema.yaml stays minimal; decompose/partOf/allocate/connect/trace are provided here.

  edge_kinds_extension:
    decompose:
      from: ["Block", "Component", "Function"]
      to: ["Block", "Component", "Function"]
      semantics: "Hierarchical decomposition (parent → child)"
      cardinality: "0..*"
      note: "Used for hierarchical breakdown of system elements"

    partOf:
      from: ["Port", "Block", "Component"]
      to: ["Block", "Component"]
      semantics: "Containment/belonging (part → whole)"
      cardinality: "0..*"
      note: "Inverse of composition relationship"

    allocate:
      from: "Function"
      to: ["Component", "Block"]
      semantics: "Function → Structure allocation (Function → Component/Block)"
      cardinality: "0..*"
      note: "Maps functional architecture to physical architecture"

    connect:
      from: "Port"
      to: "Port"
      semantics: "Port-to-port connection (Port → Port)"
      cardinality: "0..*"
      note: "Represents interface connections"

    trace:
      from:
        - "Need"
        - "Requirement"
        - "ValidationQuestion"
        - "VerificationCase"
        - "ValidationEvidence"
        - "Agreement"
        - "Function"
        - "Component"
        - "Block"
        - "Port"
      to:
        - "Need"
        - "Requirement"
        - "ValidationQuestion"
        - "VerificationCase"
        - "ValidationEvidence"
        - "Agreement"
        - "Function"
        - "Component"
        - "Block"
        - "Port"
      semantics: "Generic trace (1-hop, semantics defined by dictionary/usage)"
      cardinality: "0..*"
      note: "Generic traceability link when specific relationship is not defined"
